This plugin provides the ability to configure editors per-post.

== Description ==

Per Post Editors is a plugin that adds to the WordPress permissions models, allowing you to assign specific users to be editors
of specific posts or pages.

To summarize:

* Allow specific users to edit a post or page
* Editors are assigned directly inside the post itself - there are no other admin settings

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:

1. Download `per-post-editors.zip`
2. Unzip
3. Upload `per-post-editors` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory
4. Go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin


== Documentation ==

Full documentation can be found on the [User Permissions Page](http://lunarmobiscuit.com/plugins/per-post-editors/) page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require any changes to roles? =

No, it works with any account and any role.

= Does this plugin allow users to create new posts? =

No, you use the existing roles for those permissions.  This plugin does not change any of the existing admin menus.  E.g. a Subscriber who is allowed to edit a post does not see a Posts menu item in the wp-admin page, but will see an "Edit Post" on the admin header if it is visible.

= Does this plugin restrict reading of pages or posts? =

No, there are other plugins that provide that function.  This plugin is just about restricting the ability to edit a page or post to a specific account.
